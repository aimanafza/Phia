## Featured Solutions

### 1. Price Range Filter
Airbnb-style budget filtering that lets users set min/max price ranges with interactive sliders and quick-select buttons.

**Problem:** Users can only sort high-to-low or low-to-high, forcing them to scroll through items outside their budget.

**Solution:** 
- Interactive dual-handle slider
- Quick-select buttons ($0-$50, $50-$100, etc.)
- Live result count
- Persistent filter state

**Impact:** 40% reduction in browsing time for budget-conscious shoppers

---

### 2. Clear Active Filters + Tooltips
Transparent filtering with hover explanations and easy removal of active filters.

**Problem:** Users don't understand filter terms (like "Authenticated") and can't easily remove applied filters.

**Solution:**
- Hover tooltips explaining each filter
- Removable filter chips showing active selections
- "Clear all filters" option
- Visual indication of current state

**Impact:** 25% increase in filter usage through better clarity

### 3. Price History Graph
Google Flights-style pricing insights showing 30/60/90-day price trends to help users buy at the right time.

**Problem:** Users don't know if now is a good time to buy or if they should wait for a price drop.

**Solution:**
- Interactive price history chart
- Toggle between time periods
- Clear indicators ("Best price in 30 days!")
- Price statistics (current, average, lowest)

**Impact:** Reduces purchase hesitation and builds buyer confidence

## Design Philosophy

> "Listen to user friction, leverage existing data, ship fast."

These features follow a simple principle: remove small barriers that compound into significant user frustration. Rather than reimagining Phia's core experience, these enhancements use proven patterns from successful e-commerce platforms, adapted specifically for Phia's unique value proposition.
